## Overview
I was born, and currently reside, in Bedfordshire, England.

I have a mortgage and a pickup truck.

## Personal Profile
I am hardworking and loyal, willing to go the extra mile.

I am happy to teach, where I can, but also keen to learn from someone else.

You will find me able to work by myself or contribute as part of a team.

I am well-spoken and can discuss technical problems, and solutions, with non-technical colleagues.

I understand that business does not stop at 5.30pm so our servers and code need to be relied upon or fixed any time of the day or night.

I love a challenge and am keen to push my skills forwards and learn from a new role and the people around me.

## Core Skills
Most of what I work with right now is with core `PHP` although I do have some exposure to `Codeigniter` and `Symfony`. I am working through a `Laravel` course on Udemy and am happy to learn any frameworks or tools required.

I write `MySQL` reports on an almost daily basis. I can read the EXPLAIN and use profiling.

I am confident in `bash`, using the command line daily, and can write shell scripts to help me with tasks. Most of our servers are `Centos 7` but I have also used `Debian`-based distros. We use `Apache` to manage the majority of our vhosts but we also use `nginx` when we need something niche such as proxying to a different PHP version.

I use `Docker Compose` to build environments for development, most recently for `ElasticSearch` and `Kibana`, but primarily for our `LAMP` stack which I enhanced with `MITM proxy`, `PHPUnit`, `PHPStan` and `New Relic` to aid development.

Although I have been working primarily on the back end, I do know things like `HTML`, `Javascript`, `jQuery`, `CSS`, `Bootstrap`, `Materialize`.

I use `git` for version control (with `BitBucket`) via the command line.

## Experience
